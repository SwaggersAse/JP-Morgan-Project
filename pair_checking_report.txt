Pair2:
Component: The selling algorithm
Original problem of algorithm:
Problems founded during meeting: When the trader wants to submit a big order(amount of its suborder > 5000), the system would crash.
Reason:
When the suborder failed to be sold, the market would return an error message which our system cannot handle properly(fixed). 
How to do we fix it:
	Add exception handling for the error and re-split the order the smaller suborders
Problem founded during meeting:
While one order is executing, new submitted orders will be dropped by our system. (not fixed)
The submitted time of the original orders should be the marketâ€™s time(its local time currently) (not fixed)
